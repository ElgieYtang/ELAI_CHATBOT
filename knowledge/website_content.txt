This website is an academic final project developed by a 4th year
Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student from
the University of Cebu – Main Campus.

The project focuses on designing and deploying an AI-powered chatbot
integrated into a website using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Flowise for chatbot orchestration, Ollama for local language model
execution, and Cloudflare Tunnel for public deployment.
